<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/06/Capture-One-Pro.html">#</a></span> <p>Yesterday, at about this time, I said that I wanted to <a href="posts/2022/01/05/Good-morning.html">move my photo editing back to Capture One Pro</a>. I later spent a few hours doing just that. Yes, yes, I know, I do this all the time and always end up back in Lightroom Classic. That may happen again this time, but what I'm always reminded of is that I get photos I like better out of C1 faster and more easily than I do with LrC. And when I want to get fancy, C1 does a better job also (layers!). I almost never drop into Photoshop, but I suppose if I do more "real" portraits, I'll need it for retouching. C1 is just nicer. It's also better when switching between the big and little screens because the layouts are so customizable. I have a custom layout for both screens. Tethering from the Leicas works like butter in C1, too. So, Lightroom has "easier" going for it, but C1 wins at just about everything else.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/04/Big-screens-are-bad-for-.html">Big screens are bad for me</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I use a 32-inch monitor on my desk at home and I love it. I can do one big thing like, say, editing photos with room to spare. Or, I can do a bunch of small things all at once. </p>
<p>It's that second part that gets me. Most of the time I can see the windows of at least a half-dozen different apps at once. This has been causing me some consternation. I find myself flitting about between apps and windows and tasks, simply because I happen to notice something somewhere on the screen.</p>
<p>I've noticed that whenever I detach the MBP and work on only the "little" 14-inch screen, I feel much more focused. Calmer, even. It's happening right now as I type this. The Tinderbox note window I'm typing in takes up most of the screen, leaving me to relax and pay attention to what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Of course it depends on the task. Launching Lightroom Classic is a harsh reminder of the limited the screen real estate here. If I needed an IDE and browser and terminal side-by-side all the time I'd feel cramped. But for general computing stuff, email, blogging, etc. Smaller may be better. </p>
<p>Here's the window size from the MBP after plugging it into the big monitor. You can see why I'd feel cramped.</p>

In recent months, I've come to realize that I almost never need the stuff in my logs when I'm out and about. I <i>worry</i> about needing it, but don't. Most of the things I think I might need are nice-to-haves. There are a few things I do occasionally truly need, so I just keep them in Apple Notes. I think I'm finally learning to tell the difference.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/03/Apple-Photos-vs-Lightroo.html">Apple Photos vs Lightroom Classic as photo library</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I have nearly 100,000 photos in Adobe Lightroom (Classic). Lightroom is only useful on my Mac and is rather clunky to use as a library. The new Lightroom is nicer, and syncs everywhere, but I don't want to rely on Adobe's cloud.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of using Apple Photos as my library. It's on all my devices automatically. It's simple and looks nice enough. Nearly every photo-related app can access the library directly, obviating the need to "share" from app to app. My family uses it, so shared albums are easy for them to find. Plus, it has face and object recognition and really good OS integration. Photos is also the most likely app I'll still be using in 10+ years.</p>
<p>Using Photos means that rather than importing photos taken on my phone into Lightroom, I export photos I've processed with Lightroom into Photos. </p>
<p>The big downside here is that my LrC library only contains locally-imported photos, and my phone contains all my iPhone photos plus just the images I've exported from LrC. I have no one canonical place with <i>everything</i>. I can't decide if this matters.</p>
<p>I could configure Lightroom on my phone to automatically sync photos back into my library, but then I have to be careful about re-importing to Photos so I don't end up with duplicates. This has happened before. </p>
<p>I may also try PhotoSync again to see if I can find a way to have the best of both worlds.</p>

	<p>Publishing this blog using <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> is certainly complex, but is it also too complicated?</p>
<p>There are many moving parts: agents, rules, expressions, action code, attributes, and so on. But to simply publish this post, all I do is hit return, type some words, and click a button. Not complicated at all. However, if I decide to change something, or if I change something by accident, all hell might break loose. </p>
<p>Publishing is simple here, but running the show is pretty complicated. Still, this setup is fun, lightweight, super flexible, and ultimately renders a static site. I'm thinking it's a fair balance.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Dave Rogers<a href="https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2022/January_2022.html#note_798"> posted a note</a> about complexity and Tinderbox and it's made me feel a bit better. His blog, <a href="https://nice-marmot.net">Nice Marmot</a>, is one of the things that inspired me to dive back to Tinderbox for personal blogging. I'm glad I did. Thanks, Dave!</p>

	<p>I bought my first <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/about/">Hobonichi Techo</a> in 2013, and I've used one every year since. One of my favorite things in any new year is copying over events from last year's calendar into the new one. Birthdays, anniversaries, etc. It's a much better feeling than something like waiting for Facebook to tell me when to pay attention to someone.</p>
<p>Another thing I do every January is plan on going all-in with the Techo. Todos, appointments, notes, lists, everything should go in that lovely book with its wonderful Tomoe River paper. But then I worry about it being too small. With big plans to use analog tools even more this year, will the little Hobonichi be too limiting?</p>
<p>The answer to that question has always been, "No." Most of those Techos on my shelf are at least half empty. I'd wager there aren't more than a couple dozen pages where I could have used more room.</p>
<p>What this all means is that I have not learned my lesson and will be once again diving right into the plans to use the Techo for everything. The difference this time is that I'm not going to worry about running out of room. I hope that will mean that I do run out of room, because wouldn't that be awesome.</p>

	<p>I bought my first Leica, an M6 TTL in 2004. I've bought and sold a number of them since then. I currently own an M3, M6, MP, Q2 Monochrom, and SL2-S. In the above timeline, film cameras are green and digital cameras are yellow. Can you spot which type I tend to keep longer? The dates should be mostly accurate. There are some conflicting notes on my old blog, but they occur in 2012 which is the year I really messed things up during a platform change, so I've used my Lightroom catalog and Flickr data when in doubt. I also have some notes suggesting that I've owned two Leica M7s but I don't remember that at all.</p>
<p>The future for me probably holds a beat-up original M10 at some point after the M11 is released. Prices should get more reasonable then. I'll probably end up selling the M6 to fund it or something like it. Or maybe I'll sell the MP one day, although the thought makes me shudder. I've had friends say to me, "Never sell a Leica. You always regret selling a Leica." I should probably heed their advice.</p>
