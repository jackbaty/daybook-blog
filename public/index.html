<p>Somehow, some part of their attention is directed toward the possibility that their application environment isn't "ideal." They have this notion there's some perfect writing environment that will make them more productive or better writers by eliminating this thing called "distraction." There's some anxiety about the tool they're using.</p>

<p>Dave's right. I've gone through many iterations around "distraction-free" writing myself. In my case, though, I don't do it because I feel the writing environment is holding me back. I do it because it can be fun to twiddle with tools. Same with cameras. My cameras have been better than my ability for years, but I still keep trying new cameras because I love cameras.</p>
<p>Oh, and about distraction-free writing in Tinderbox, I wrote <a href="https://archive.baty.net/2012/tinderbox-as-a-minimalist-writing-environment/">Tinderbox as a Minimalist Writing Environment</a> in 2013. (Unfortunately, all of the site's images from 2012 were lost during one of many platform migrations.)</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/26/Speaking-of-distractions.html">#</a></span> <p>This week started out with the intention of building a Rails app, but ended with the creation of an entirely new Tinderbox Daybook and blogging system. You're soaking in it. I'm still considering moving the whole enterprise to baty.blog and just living with that for a while. However, I still wonder about returning it to <a href="http://rudimentarylathe.org">rudimentarylathe.org</a> or maybe even replacing the photography domain <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>. And who knows, I may end with all of this back in Emacs in a month. But Tinderbox is still super fun and powerful and let's try it!</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/26/Note-icons-on-the-archiv.html">#</a></span> <p>Tinderbox does this cool thing in outlines where the icon changes based on the age and size of each note. I'm working on mimicking that feature here. I'm a little lost when it comes to the new "functions" features in Tinderbox 9.1 so I fell back to adding some Action code as an Edict. Like this...</p>

<pre>
if ($TextLength>500) {
    	$NoteIcon="long.png";
}
if ($TextLength>50 & $TextLength<=500) {
    	$NoteIcon ="medium.png";

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/25/It-s-Christmas.html">#</a></span> <p>Good morning. It's 4:35 am on Christmas morning. It'll be nice just hanging out with the family today, but with no young children around, Christmas doesn't have the magic it once did. I'm not a religious person, so Christmas is not much more than a thinly-veiled celebration of consumerism. The lights are pretty, and the food is good, though. Everyone will be up and around before long and I'll get into the swing of things soon enough.</p>

	<p>I learned about a new note-taking app, <a href="https://www.tatatap.com">/tap</a>, so of course I gave it a spin.  /tap is about creating short, "smart" notes. "Bite-size notes with special stuff."</p>
<p>Most of the interaction with /tap is done via typing. So you can put a note in the "to-read" folder by starting the note with "<code>/to-read</code>". There's <code>#tagging</code> also. It gets fun when adding "events" and "beans". An event tracks things that happen each day. Good for tracking, say, meditation or workouts. Beans are simple counters. Add beans with "<code>+mybean:10</code>", for example. Events and Beans are tracked separately and can be seen in special views by date or by account. </p>
<p>/tap is a simple but clever app with some fun ideas. I love its simple, sparse design. /tap is a web app and costs $7/month. This comes with the usual concerns about privacy and longevity, but for some it might be just the ticket.</p>

So much for my dream of maintaining just one site for everything. And Coping Mechanism is still out there, even though I've had a TODO in my inbox for a which which says, "Delete the <a href="https://baty.blog">Copingmechanism.com</a> instance." The idea was to use this site instead of the wiki for daily notes, and baty.blog for everything else. But then just this morning I wrote what could be considered a "real" blog post with <a href="posts/2021/12/25/Trying-a-new-app-tap.html">Trying a new app, /tap</a>. Shouldn't that go on the blog? Probably, but I was already here, if you know what I mean. Sigh. Still noodlin'.</p>

The photographer(s) are unknown, but most of the images were taken in and around Grand Rapids, MI sometime during the first couple of decades of the 20th century. Just look at all the fun happening in this image. The kid on the rope swing. The young woman about to dive into the river. The gathering of boys on the bank, watching. The bicycle.

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/23/Again-with-Tinderbox.html">#</a></span> <p>Funny that Alex mentions Tinderbox, since I’ve been keeping up with my Tinderbox Daybook for a week or so. And I also posted again to notes.baty.net, which is built using Tinderbox, just for fun. The scary part is that I started thinking about combining the notes blog and my daybook into one giant Tinderbox document for 2022. How cool would it be to have all my stuff in one place (that’s not Emacs)? It solves the related problem of public vs private notes. Using Tinderbox makes it easy to publish only what I want, where I want. I can also pull in parts of private outlines and notes into the published areas. Hmmm.</p>

<p>That does it. I’m creating a brand new Tinderbox document with the intention of combining my Daybook and Blog documents for 2022. This will work nicely as a way to avoid doing anything actually useful today.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/11/24/Today.html">#</a></span> <p>There are several ways to approach images in ox-hugo. I’m trying three of them in this post :). First, I drag and drop an image into the buffer and it’s automatically, via org-attach, moved into ./attach/XX/UUIDfilename.jpg. A link is inserted and when rendering markdown, it uses Hugo’s “figure” short code. This is the easiest option to do, but has the most moving parts. I don’t like that I don’t have control over the precise path. Second, I just link to the URL of an image in SmugMug. Super easy, but I do have to upload the image then grab the “share” link. Not bad. The third option is to generate a local file link like [[img/foo.jpg]]. This feels the most self-contained and tidy, but means exporting a specifically-sized image, naming it something, copying that name, and moving it into the static/img/etc. folder. I’ll probably try all three ways for a bit to see which feels best.</p>
<p>I’ve been having a lot of fun in the darkroom lately.</p>

<p>Blogging with Drummer feels like using someone else’s bathroom. I really have to go, and it’s a nice bathroom, but it’s not mine and I can’t really relax, ya know</p>
