	<p>I'd never intended for the new daily notes site to live at <a href="http://daily.baty.net">daily.baty.net</a>. That was for testing. It stuck around longer than I would have preferred, but I've finally made the move and replaced the Ghost blog with this Tinderbox-managed site at https://baty.blog.</p>
<p>It's being pushed to both the old and new domains for the time being. At some point over the next few days I'll pull the plug on the old domain.</p>

Because I made what I thought was a small, safe change, and broke half the site. Then, I stepped on the "Topics" attribute and lost all of my posts' tags. This whole thing feels a touch fragile, and it made me look longingly at Emacs and my old version of the blog using org-mode and Hugo. Then I remembered how even that sometimes broke for odd reasons, and crawled back into Tinderbox.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/09/Should-I-crosspost-to-Mi.html">Should I crosspost to Micro.blog?</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I find myself missing <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>. The community there is unmatched by any that I've found elsewhere. I sometimes miss the occasional interaction around my posts. </p>
<p>Living alone on my blog has been a deliberate choice. I wanted to make blogging less performative. After all, I write for myself, first, and if others get something from it, then yay. But that's a side effect.</p>
<p>Except it gets lonely. Not many people actually visit this site. If I'm being honest, I enjoy sharing things. It's nice to be heard, at least a little.</p>
<p>So, yesterday I built a new RSS feed here that I think will work for Micro.blog. Now I just need to decide if and when to turn it on.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/08/Shooting-film-when-I-m-i.html">Shooting film when I'm in the mood</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>Over the past several years, my interest in shooting film has regularly ebbed and flowed. This fluctuation wouldn't be a problem if the frequency and amplitude weren't so high. My brain does this thing where it decides, usually after a successful roll or inspiring blog post, that I'm now going to "shoot only film from now on!" This is immediately followed by the purchase of supporting cameras or other gear.</p>
<p>A short time later, I tire of waiting to finish a roll, even though when I'm in film mode I claim that "waiting is a feature". The digital cameras come out and I start wondering why I bother with the hassle of film, when digital is "better", faster, and cheaper. I should sell off most of the film gear, shutter the darkroom, and just learn how to make decent inkjet prints instead.</p>
<p>And then, I finally finish that roll, process it, scan it, and make a couple of darkroom prints. Wow! This is so cool and fun and I love the images and I love having the negatives neatly organized in binders on my shelves for future generations of scholars and historians. (ha!).</p>
<p>So, what I'm saying is that I enjoy both film and digital. I should learn that about myself. I should build processes around both, as needed, and stop trying to decide which I want to do exclusively and realize that it all depends upon my mood.</p>

I recently sold my M10-R, so of course I'm interested in what's next for Leica. My god, how I hate speculation. The discussions are boring and useless and I'm going to stop reading them. The good news is that, based on the specs, I see no pressing need for owning an M11. </p>

	<blockquote>Instead of storing the data on-chain, NFTs instead contain a URL that points to the data. What surprised me about the standards was that there’s no hash commitment for the data located at the URL. Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some VPS running Apache somewhere. Anyone with access to that machine, anyone who buys that domain name in the future, or anyone who compromises that machine can change the image, title, description, etc for the NFT to whatever they’d like at any time (regardless of whether or not they “own” the token). There’s nothing in the NFT spec that tells you what the image “should” be, or even allows you to confirm whether something is the “correct” image.</blockquote>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/08/New-RSS-feed-for-all-pos.html">New RSS feed for all posts</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I built this site's RSS feed so that it only includes the big daily posts, one per day, but that post is appended to throughout the day. This feels right for most people. It doesn't work if I want to crosspost, though, since the first published version is usually only me saying "Good morning" and that would be it.</p>
<p>I've added a second RSS feed, <a href="https://baty.blog/allposts.xml">allposts.xml</a>, which includes each individual post, independent of the containing day's post. I'll use this feed for crossposting. To keep things from becoming too noisy, I've added an attribute, "Crosspost" which defaults to false. Only those posts with $Crosspost==true are included in the feed. Clear as mud?</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/07/Photo-processing-workflo.html">Photo processing workflow update, Jan 2022</a></h3>

<section>


	<img src="/img/small/photomechanic.png" alt="Photo processing workflow update, Jan 2022" class="sideImage">

	<p>TL;DR: I'm back to a combination of <a href="https://www.captureone.com/en">Capture One Pro</a> and <a href="https://home.camerabits.com/tour-photo-mechanic/">Photo Mechanic Plus</a>, with a dash of Apple Photos.</p>
<p>I continue to waffle on which app to use for which portion of my photography workflow. Most recently, I'd considered <a href="posts/2022/01/03/Apple-Photos-vs-Lightroo.html">Apple Photos vs Lightroom Classic as photo library</a>. This was fueled by my desire to keep my library and my editing tool separate. LrC is probably the best all-around solution, and is the closest thing we have to an "industry standard". But, I prefer Capture One Pro for RAW processing. </p>
<p>Capture One's catalog is mediocre, so I've built a new catalog of all my photos using  Photo Mechanic (Plus). This lets me work with "Sessions" in C1, which I much prefer. I wish PM's UI for browsing its catalog was prettier, even if that meant it was less powerful. Still, it's quite fast and powerful.</p>
<p>Apple Photos is great for sharing and just having my photos with me on all devices, so I've added "Export to Apple Photos" as a final step.</p>
<p>Here's my current workflow for digital camera images.</p>
<p>In Capture One:</p>
<ul><li> Import from card into Capture One session's Import folder</li>
<li> Delete anything I don't like (ruthlessly)</li>
<li> Edit any keepers</li>
<li> Export a finished JPEG into the same folder as original image</li></ul>
<p>In Photo Mechanic</p>
<ul><li> View the import folder in Photo Mechanic</li>
<li> Rate, keyword, and caption each image</li>
<li> Move all images into dated folders and add to PM catalog</li>
<li> Export full-size version of any starred images to Apple Photos</li>
<li> Share and upload as needed</li></ul>
<p>This means I spend only enough time in Capture One to edit select images and "burn" JPEG copies. Then it's off to Photo Mechanic for metadata and organization. Then out to Apple Photos for sharing with family and any other apps. The "big catalog" is Photo Mechanic.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/06/Capture-One-Pro.html">#</a></span> <p>Yesterday, at about this time, I said that I wanted to <a href="posts/2022/01/05/Good-morning.html">move my photo editing back to Capture One Pro</a>. I later spent a few hours doing just that. Yes, yes, I know, I do this all the time and always end up back in Lightroom Classic. That may happen again this time, but what I'm always reminded of is that I get photos I like better out of C1 faster and more easily than I do with LrC. And when I want to get fancy, C1 does a better job also (layers!). I almost never drop into Photoshop, but I suppose if I do more "real" portraits, I'll need it for retouching. C1 is just nicer. It's also better when switching between the big and little screens because the layouts are so customizable. I have a custom layout for both screens. Tethering from the Leicas works like butter in C1, too. So, Lightroom has "easier" going for it, but C1 wins at just about everything else.</p>
