Moving <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> to a more blog-friendly template made things confusing. And now this Tinderbox blog is getting so nice that the problem is even worse. They're now both very similar. Too similar.  I think I have to put <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> back as a photography-focused blog with an overwrought template, just to differentiate it from this one. I'm also considering moving this blog to baty.blog and eliminating the Ghost instance running there. And I kind of want to bring back the rudimentarylathe.org domain. The elephant in the room, of course, is that you just know I'll change things again in a week or a month or a year. Then what? Broken links, RSS noise, confusion, etc. Anyone reading care to chime in?</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2021/12/30/Weight-logging-with-Tind.html">Weight logging with Tinderbox</a></h3>

<section>


	<img src="..//img/small/tinderboxicon.png" alt="Weight logging with Tinderbox" class="sideImage">

	<p><i>Note: This was originally posted over at <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> but I thought it belonged here instead</i>.</p>
<p>I kept a ‚Äúdaybook‚Äù using <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> for years. I drifted away from Tinderbox for a few years after I became infatuated with Linux or iOS or other ‚Äúcross-platform‚Äù systems. Right now, I‚Äôm back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>While rebuilding my Daybook, I wanted to make logging my weight easier. It‚Äôs not like it was difficult, but I wanted to tweak it.</p>
<p>Tinderbox is an outliner, so my weight entries are collected under a ‚ÄúWeight Log‚Äù node. It looked like this (I obviously wasn‚Äôt consistent with tracking last year).</p>
<img src="/img/2021/20211230-weight-log.png">
<p>The weight is stored in a numeric User Attribute called, surprisingly, ‚ÄúWeight‚Äù. The outline shows a custom ‚ÄúDisplayFormat‚Äù so that it reads nicely:</p>
<p><code>$Weight + " pounds on " + format($StartDate,"MM D")</code></p>
<p>To enter a new weight, I‚Äôd select an existing item in the outline, hit Return to create a new note, type in the weight, hit Return to save the note, then use the mouse to click the ‚ÄúWeight‚Äù attribute and re-enter the weight there. So much clicking! ¬†üòÄ.</p>
<p>What I wanted to do was to type the weight once in the note‚Äôs Name and have the Weight attribute populated automatically. Tinderbox notes can have ‚ÄúRules‚Äù which are commands that run periodically and can update a note‚Äôs attributes based on just about any criteria. I could have created a rule that set the Weight based on the Name, but that seemed like overkill since this only ever needs to happen once per note.</p>
<p>With some help from Michael Becker, I think I‚Äôve got it. (You should check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQCp8tVRJSg&list=PL6MVDtSfcKxd2XLpenMAd9H4VknDyn6oz">video series on Mastering Tinderbox</a> for all sorts of great Tinderbox content.)</p>
<p>There‚Äôs an OnAdd action which sets the Prototype, Date, and Name of the note. (Setting the Name of the new note to ‚ÄúEnter Weight‚Äù is a nice touch.)</p>
<p><code>$Prototype="pWeightLogEntry";$Date|=date(today);if($Name=="untitled"){$Name="Enter Weight"};</code></p>
<p>Then, the new note gets a Rule (via the pWeightLogEntry Prototype) which sets the Weight attribute based on the value of Name:</p>

<code><pre>
$Weight|=$Name;
if($Weight>0){
$Name=$Date("l");
$RuleDisabled=true};</pre></code>

<p>The trick here is setting $RuleDisabled=true. What this does is force the Rule to run only once, which is all I need. I wasn‚Äôt aware of the $RuleDisabled attribute, so thanks to Michael for that tip.</p>
<p>Now, to add a new Weight Log entry, I hit Return, type my weight, and hit Return again. Couldn‚Äôt be any easier! On my Daybooks ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù I can graph my weight over time, like so‚Ä¶</p>
<img src="/img/2021/20211230-weight.png">
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with Tinderbox, I‚Äôm sorry if I made too many assumptions here. Explaining Tinderbox can be an entire job in itself!</p>

It doesn't sync both ways, but it will import new notes from within those watched places and make new notes in a Tinderbox outline. This makes it easy to add notes to my Tinderbox file from a phone or iPad. It wouldn't be too much trouble to just copy and paste, but watched folders make it even easier.</p>

		<img src="/img/2021/20211229-today.png" alt="Today agent in Tinderbox" class="postimage">
</figure>


	<p>I have a top-level Agent in my Tinderbox daybook named "Today". All it does is collect notes using a <code>$Date=date(today);</code> query.  Given that I'm putting both blog content and personal logging into the document, the Today container is a handy way to see everything going on today. I'll probably modify it to use a date attribute so I can easily jump to any day and see what I wrote then. Neat.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: I did change the agent query to use my $Date attribute, like this:</p>
<p><code>$Date=$Date(agent);</code></p>
<p>I also changed the agent's $DisplayExpression to reflect the day: </p>
<p><code>"Created " + if($Date==date(today)){"Today"} else {$Date.format("l");}</code></p>
<p>So now I just set the $Date attribute of the "Today" agent to any date and it collects all the dated content created that day.</p>

		<img src="/img/2021/20211229-dash.png" alt="The beginnings of my Tinderbox 2022 Dashboard" class="postimage">
</figure>


	<p>I'm rebuilding my Tinderbox "Dashboard" for the new year. I neglected the whole Daybook last year but I'm determined to not let that happen this year.</p>
<p>The dashboard is a Tinderbox "Map" view littered with agents showing various summary and aggregate information from the entire document.</p>
<p>In the "Days remaining this year" note, I used to only show the resulting integer. I'd forgotten that in map view, notes can visually plot the values of various attributes (as in the Weight Graph, shown). The note's edict (an edict is like a rule, but runs less often) sets the note's $Subtitle to the number of days remaining in the year, like so:</p>
<p><code>$Subtitle=days(date("today"),date("12/31/2021 6:00 PM"))</code></p>
<p>I cheated in the screenshot using "42" because with only 2 days left this year, it doesn't make for a great demo. The inspector for that note looks like this:</p>
<img src="/img/2021/20211229-inspector.png">
<p>The note uses the built-in "Dashboard" prototype to make things prettier.</p>
<p>The note's $DisplayExpression is simply <code>$Name + ": " + $Subtitle</code></p>
<p>Neat, eh?</p>

	<p>I've used some version of Leica M camera since 2004. I love them so much that I recently purchased a brand new MP film camera, which is awesome. Only a month ago, I was finally able to get the latest digital M, the M10-R. Surprisingly, I didn't love it. I wanted to love it. I <i>thought</i> I'd love it. I didn't. </p>
<p>The M10-R was going to be my everyday carry camera. That didn't work out. </p>
<p>The M is a slow, manual-focus, deliberate camera. It's not really suited for just having around taking snaps. It only focuses down to like three feet. Manual focus means that every shot requires two hands. It's very very expensive, so letting it just dangle around my neck while not paying attention to it is a terrible idea. I love the <i>idea</i> of a digital M, but the execution leaves me wanting.</p>
<p>So I'm going back to a Q2 Monochrom :).</p>

Tinderbox is awesome but blogging with it requires a lot of setup and probably long-term fiddling. WordPress can do anything but feels clumsy. Ghost is slick and fast but feels focused on "building an audience" and doesn't have comments or stats. Hugo is cool and fast and I get to use Emacs, but it's also very <i>separate</i> from the actual rendered content. TiddlyWiki isn't for blogging, even though it can be coerced into it. I'll never be able to choose just one option and stick with it for more than, say 72 hours. For example right now I have 3 of my sites loaded in tabs and am weighing pros and cons of each and determining if any of them could be The One. I hate this.</p>

<p>Dave's right. I've gone through many iterations around "distraction-free" writing myself. In my case, though, I don't do it because I feel the writing environment is holding me back. I do it because it can be fun to twiddle with tools. Same with cameras. My cameras have been better than my ability for years, but I still keep trying new cameras because I love cameras.</p>

<pre>
if ($TextLength>500) {
    	$NoteIcon="long.png";
}
if ($TextLength>50 & $TextLength<=500) {
    	$NoteIcon ="medium.png";
}
if ($TextLength<50) {
	$NoteIcon ="small.png";
}
if ($Image) {$NoteIcon = "cam.png"};
</pre>

Later, I see shots other people casually snapped with their iPhones or whatever and posted them (with no editing) directly to social media. They're often much better than mine. Am I just wasting my time?</p>

<p>This is how NFTs make me feel: like the future is useless but expensive, and world-altering technology is now in the hands of a culture so aesthetically and spiritually impoverished that it should maybe go back to telling stories around the cooking fire for a while, just to remember how to mean something.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/25/It-s-Christmas.html">#</a></span> <p>Good morning. It's 4:35 am on Christmas morning. It'll be nice just hanging out with the family today, but with no young children around, Christmas doesn't have the magic it once did. I'm not a religious person, so Christmas is not much more than a thinly-veiled celebration of consumerism. The lights are pretty, and the food is good, though. Everyone will be up and around before long and I'll get into the swing of things soon enough.</p>

	<p>I learned about a new note-taking app, <a href="https://www.tatatap.com">/tap</a>, so of course I gave it a spin.  /tap is about creating short, "smart" notes. "Bite-size notes with special stuff."</p>
<p>Most of the interaction with /tap is done via typing. So you can put a note in the "to-read" folder by starting the note with "<code>/to-read</code>". There's <code>#tagging</code> also. It gets fun when adding "events" and "beans". An event tracks things that happen each day. Good for tracking, say, meditation or workouts. Beans are simple counters. Add beans with "<code>+mybean:10</code>", for example. Events and Beans are tracked separately and can be seen in special views by date or by account. </p>
<p>/tap is a simple but clever app with some fun ideas. I love its simple, sparse design. /tap is a web app and costs $7/month. This comes with the usual concerns about privacy and longevity, but for some it might be just the ticket.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/25/Should-this-site-be-at-b.html">#</a></span> <p>I'm still working through the differences between this site and the blog at baty.blog. So much for my dream of maintaining just one site for everything. And Coping Mechanism is still out there, even though I've had a TODO in my inbox for a which which says, "Delete the <a href="https://baty.blog">Copingmechanism.com</a> instance." The idea was to use this site instead of the wiki for daily notes, and baty.blog for everything else. But then just this morning I wrote what could be considered a "real" blog post with <a href="posts/2021/12/25/Trying-a-new-app-tap.html">Trying a new app, /tap</a>. Shouldn't that go on the blog? Probably, but I was already here, if you know what I mean. Sigh. Still noodlin'.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/24/River.html">#</a></span> <p>I love this image so much. It's from a pile of negatives I bought from someone on Craigslist like 15 years ago. The photographer(s) are unknown, but most of the images were taken in and around Grand Rapids, MI sometime during the first couple of decades of the 20th century. Just look at all the fun happening in this image. The kid on the rope swing. The young woman about to dive into the river. The gathering of boys on the bank, watching. The bicycle. I just love it!</p>
