	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/14/Checking-in-after-a-coup.html">Checking in after a couple months of blogging with Tinderbox</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>Early last November, in <a href="posts/2021/11/04/Welcome-back-I-guess.html">Welcome back, I guess</a>, I wrote this:</p>
	<blockquote>If I'm being honest, I'll admit that this is just an excuse to play with some old toys and experiment with new ones. </blockquote>
	<blockquote>See also: Sometimes I change my mind</blockquote>

<p>Let's look at how it's going with my Blogging With Tinderbox experiment.</p>
<p>First, it's been a ton of fun wrangling <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> into generating a nice-looking blog that fits my particular way of blogging. I was inspired after trying Dave Winer's <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com">Drummer</a> blogging tool. Tinderbox is ridiculously flexible and powerful and fun, and made this blog possible.</p>
<p>I love outliners, and this site is built using Tinderbox's powerful version of outliner. All the <a href="https://logseq.com">cool</a> <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com">new</a> <a href="https://roamresearch.com">kids</a> are using outlines, too.</p>
<p>Keeping my "Daybook" type entries in the same Tinderbox file as my blog posts is pretty great. It lets me see everything all at once. I can link, collect, arrange, and analyze <i>everything</i> I write, whether public or private. This is not a small thing, it will likely become more useful over time.</p>
<p>So, I'll be sticking with Tinderbox for my daily notes blogging, then? Not so fast.</p>
<p>The mechanisms for generating this blog out of Tinderbox are fragile. More than once in the past week, I've broken large portions of the site after making what I thought to be a minor change to a template or Agent. Debugging it took quite some time. It makes me nervous.</p>
<p>Links are powerful but strange in Tinderbox. For a simple blog, I don't need powerful. I need them to be easily created and simple to edit. I don't find them to be.</p>
<p>The elephant in the room is Emacs, and, more specifically, Org mode. You see, as much as I like managing and processing notes in Tinderbox, I don't love <i>writing</i> in it. Notes in Tinderbox are rich text. Sure, technically you can have them behave as if they're Markdown, but doing so is definitely swimming upstream. Tinderbox does a good job of converting rich notes into HTML, and even offers control over how formatting is rendered. It's all very clever. However, it's a long way from plain text, and I prefer plain text for writing. And I very much enjoy writing plain text in Emacs.</p>
<p>I haven't decided yet which way I'll be taking this blog. For the moment, I like the results so much that I'm happy using Tinderbox. But I feel the pull of Emacs and the simplicity of Org mode and Markdown. I'm still hoping to find a way to have both.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/14/I-ve-tweaked-a-few-layou.html">#</a></span> <p>I've tweaked the design here just a little. The header graphic is back. I got bored with just a big, blue rectangle. We'll see how long I like it this way. Paragraph and post spacing have been adjusted to (I hope) make it easier to read and scan. Also, the titled posts titles are no longer blue. There was too much blue. This makes "blue is a link" inconsistent, but hopefully not troublingly inconsistent.</p> 

</div>






<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/14/Just-scroll-past-it.html">#</a></span> <p>Occasionally, the internet becomes littered with some latest fad, meme, or topic. It peppers my feeds and I want it to stop. Then, I realize that I scroll past dozens of things I'm uninterested in every day. It's just as easy to simply scroll past this new thing as well.</p> 

</div>







	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/14/Reviewing-my-current-blo.html">Reviewing my current blogging options</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I'm already not digging my crosspost-everything-to-copingmechanism idea. Why am I doing that again? It only enables me to waffle on where I post things.</p>
<p>Let's look at my best current blogging options:</p>
<p><b>A.</b> Short, daily notes at <a href="http://daily.baty.net">daily.baty.net</a>. I could use Tinderbox or Emacs for this. Longer posts and photos would go to <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>. This would mean a different WordPress theme. The "magazine" styled theme doesn't work well for a combination of photo and text posts.</p>
<p><b>B.</b> Short and longer posts at <a href="http://daily.baty.net">daily.baty.net</a>. Photography posts at <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>. I get to keep the Hive theme, and Tinderbox makes the most sense for the daily site.</p>
<p><b>C.</b> Short posts at <a href="http://daily.baty.net">daily.baty.net</a>. Longer posts at baty.blog. Photography at <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>. OH C'MON!</p>
<p>It's gotta be either A or B. And if that's the case, the cross-posting thing seems unnecessary. It's option C that prompted that whole thing. Still noodling on it.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/11/Combining-RSS-feeds-for-.html">Combining RSS feeds for everything</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>There is an ongoing conflict between my love of trying new blogging/publishing tools and the idea of having One True Blog™. The first is for me and the second is for readers.</p>
<p>I had a thought this morning. What if I could aggregate all of my sites into a single RSS feed? There are a few approaches to this, but what I've decided to try is cross-posting everything to <a href="https://copingmechanism.com">Coping Mechanism</a>. The idea is that Coping Mechanism would grab the posts from my other sites and combine them into one giant blog whose RSS feed encapsulates everything.</p>
<p>I'm testing this with a couple of WordPress plugins: <a href="https://www.wprssaggregator.com">WP RSS Aggregator</a> and its <a href="https://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/feed-to-post/">Feed to Post</a> add-on.</p>
<p>I'll let you know if it works. If it does, those of you with an interest in following my various experiments will have a handy, single RSS feed to subscribe to. Meanwhile, I can continue writing all over the place.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/11/You-re-going-to-laugh.html">#</a></span> <p>Ok, so after implementing my new idea of consolidating posts via RSS over at <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>, I've decided that this blog can once again live at <a href="http://daily.baty.net">daily.baty.net</a>. This leaves my old Ghost blog still purring over at baty.blog. I'll just add the feeds to Coping Mechanism and y'all can just "consume" everything there. Or, if you prefer, just follow whichever individual site you like. Weird? Maybe. I wish I'd have thought of this yesterday before mucking about with everything.</p>

This whole thing feels a touch fragile, and it made me look longingly at Emacs and my old version of the blog using org-mode and Hugo.

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/09/Should-I-crosspost-to-Mi.html">Should I crosspost to Micro.blog?</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I find myself missing <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>. The community there is unmatched by any that I've found elsewhere. I sometimes miss the occasional interaction around my posts. </p>
<p>Living alone on my blog has been a deliberate choice. I wanted to make blogging less performative. After all, I write for myself, first, and if others get something from it, then yay. But that's a side effect.</p>
<p>Except it gets lonely. Not many people actually visit this site. If I'm being honest, I enjoy sharing things. It's nice to be heard, at least a little.</p>
<p>So, yesterday I built a new RSS feed here that I think will work for Micro.blog. Now I just need to decide if and when to turn it on.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/08/Shooting-film-when-I-m-i.html">Shooting film when I'm in the mood</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>Over the past several years, my interest in shooting film has regularly ebbed and flowed. This fluctuation wouldn't be a problem if the frequency and amplitude weren't so high. My brain does this thing where it decides, usually after a successful roll or inspiring blog post, that I'm now going to "shoot only film from now on!" This is immediately followed by the purchase of supporting cameras or other gear.</p>
<p>A short time later, I tire of waiting to finish a roll, even though when I'm in film mode I claim that "waiting is a feature". The digital cameras come out and I start wondering why I bother with the hassle of film, when digital is "better", faster, and cheaper. I should sell off most of the film gear, shutter the darkroom, and just learn how to make decent inkjet prints instead.</p>
<p>And then, I finally finish that roll, process it, scan it, and make a couple of darkroom prints. Wow! This is so cool and fun and I love the images and I love having the negatives neatly organized in binders on my shelves for future generations of scholars and historians. (ha!).</p>
<p>So, what I'm saying is that I enjoy both film and digital. I should learn that about myself. I should build processes around both, as needed, and stop trying to decide which I want to do exclusively and realize that it all depends upon my mood.</p>

	<blockquote>Instead of storing the data on-chain, NFTs instead contain a URL that points to the data. What surprised me about the standards was that there’s no hash commitment for the data located at the URL. Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some VPS running Apache somewhere. Anyone with access to that machine, anyone who buys that domain name in the future, or anyone who compromises that machine can change the image, title, description, etc for the NFT to whatever they’d like at any time (regardless of whether or not they “own” the token). There’s nothing in the NFT spec that tells you what the image “should” be, or even allows you to confirm whether something is the “correct” image.</blockquote>

	<p>I built this site's RSS feed so that it only includes the big daily posts, one per day, but that post is appended to throughout the day. This feels right for most people. It doesn't work if I want to crosspost, though, since the first published version is usually only me saying "Good morning" and that would be it.</p>
<p>I've added a second RSS feed, <a href="https://baty.blog/allposts.xml">allposts.xml</a>, which includes each individual post, independent of the containing day's post. I'll use this feed for crossposting. To keep things from becoming too noisy, I've added an attribute, "Crosspost" which defaults to false. Only those posts with $Crosspost==true are included in the feed. Clear as mud?</p>
