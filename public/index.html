<p>Just missing Tinderbox after my recent foray into Linux. I'm still blogging primarily at <a href="https://baty.blog">baty.blog</a>, but it's nice to say "hello" here once in a while.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/17/What-do-I-get-in-return-.html">#</a></span> <p>What do I get in return for all the time and thought I put into taking notes? I mean, I put a <i>lot</i> of thought into it. What's in it for me? I've been meticulously recording my meals since December. I can tell you how many times I ate fast food or had pancakes for breakfast. Big whoop! There is almost zero lingering value in doing it other than that it's neat. Is "neat" enough to justify the effort it took to set up the logging process and the ongoing effort of recording every meal? It's fun to set up, but if I'm honest, it's not useful. I don't need more excuses to play with my note-taking tools. I should stop doing it.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/16/Using-what-I-have.html">#</a></span> <p>After spending a week getting this Tinderbox-generated blog configured just so, I started tinkering with Emacs and ox-hugo again yesterday. Why? I think instead I should use what I have. It's pretty dialed in, so run with it, ok?</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/16/Sensor-cleaning.html">#</a></span> <p>I recently (accidentally) spit on my SL2-S's sensor while trying to blow some dust off it. (Don't do that). The first swab cleaning didn't remove the smudges. I just tried again, and really "dug in there" with the swab. It worked. Whew! That was scary.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/16/Vehicles-for-creativity.html">#</a></span> <p>I am surrounded by creative vehicles: Cameras, film, paint supplies, drawing tools, notebooks, pens, a darkroom, typewriters, and so on. They all spend most of the time either parked or up on blocks. To continue stretching the metaphor...I should just hop in and drive.</p>

Let's start your day with a photo of me from a few years ago. Note that this was not some sort of costume. I actually walked around Busch Gardens looking like this.<p></p>

Today, I discovered  <code>org-roam-node-random</code>  and it's kind of good enough as a replacement.</p>

<p>This is an example of how Org-roam will evolve. It always begins with a personal experiment based on literature, and once Iâ€™ve concluded that it works, I extract it in its minimal form and make it available for all to use.</p>
