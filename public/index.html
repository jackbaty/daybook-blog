	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/04/Big-screens-are-bad-for-.html">Big screens are bad for me</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I use a 32-inch monitor on my desk at home and I love it. I can do one big thing like, say, editing photos with room to spare. Or, I can do a bunch of small things all at once. </p>
<p>It's that second part that gets me. Most of the time I can see the windows of at least a half-dozen different apps at once. This has been causing me some consternation. I find myself flitting about between apps and windows and tasks, simply because I happen to notice something somewhere on the screen.</p>
<p>I've noticed that whenever I detach the MBP and work on only the "little" 14-inch screen, I feel much more focused. Calmer, even. It's happening right now as I type this. The Tinderbox note window I'm typing in takes up most of the screen, leaving me to relax and pay attention to what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Of course it depends on the task. Launching Lightroom Classic is a harsh reminder of the limited the screen real estate here. If I needed an IDE and browser and terminal side-by-side all the time I'd feel cramped. But for general computing stuff, email, blogging, etc. Smaller may be better. </p>
<p>Here's the window size from the MBP after plugging it into the big monitor. You can see why I'd feel cramped.</p>

In recent months, I've come to realize that I almost never need the stuff in my logs when I'm out and about. I <i>worry</i> about needing it, but don't. Most of the things I think I might need are nice-to-haves. There are a few things I do occasionally truly need, so I just keep them in Apple Notes. I think I'm finally learning to tell the difference.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/03/Apple-Photos-vs-Lightroo.html">Apple Photos vs Lightroom Classic as photo library</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I have nearly 100,000 photos in Adobe Lightroom (Classic). Lightroom is only useful on my Mac and is rather clunky to use as a library. The new Lightroom is nicer, and syncs everywhere, but I don't want to rely on Adobe's cloud.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of using Apple Photos as my library. It's on all my devices automatically. It's simple and looks nice enough. Nearly every photo-related app can access the library directly, obviating the need to "share" from app to app. My family uses it, so shared albums are easy for them to find. Plus, it has face and object recognition and really good OS integration. Photos is also the most likely app I'll still be using in 10+ years.</p>
<p>Using Photos means that rather than importing photos taken on my phone into Lightroom, I export photos I've processed with Lightroom into Photos. </p>
<p>The big downside here is that my LrC library only contains locally-imported photos, and my phone contains all my iPhone photos plus just the images I've exported from LrC. I have no one canonical place with <i>everything</i>. I can't decide if this matters.</p>
<p>I could configure Lightroom on my phone to automatically sync photos back into my library, but then I have to be careful about re-importing to Photos so I don't end up with duplicates. This has happened before. </p>
<p>I may also try PhotoSync again to see if I can find a way to have the best of both worlds.</p>

	<p>Publishing this blog using <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> is certainly complex, but is it also too complicated?</p>
<p>There are many moving parts: agents, rules, expressions, action code, attributes, and so on. But to simply publish this post, all I do is hit return, type some words, and click a button. Not complicated at all. However, if I decide to change something, or if I change something by accident, all hell might break loose. </p>
<p>Publishing is simple here, but running the show is pretty complicated. Still, this setup is fun, lightweight, super flexible, and ultimately renders a static site. I'm thinking it's a fair balance.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Dave Rogers<a href="https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2022/January_2022.html#note_798"> posted a note</a> about complexity and Tinderbox and it's made me feel a bit better. His blog, <a href="https://nice-marmot.net">Nice Marmot</a>, is one of the things that inspired me to dive back to Tinderbox for personal blogging. I'm glad I did. Thanks, Dave!</p>

	<p>I bought my first <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/about/">Hobonichi Techo</a> in 2013, and I've used one every year since. One of my favorite things in any new year is copying over events from last year's calendar into the new one. Birthdays, anniversaries, etc. It's a much better feeling than something like waiting for Facebook to tell me when to pay attention to someone.</p>
<p>Another thing I do every January is plan on going all-in with the Techo. Todos, appointments, notes, lists, everything should go in that lovely book with its wonderful Tomoe River paper. But then I worry about it being too small. With big plans to use analog tools even more this year, will the little Hobonichi be too limiting?</p>
<p>The answer to that question has always been, "No." Most of those Techos on my shelf are at least half empty. I'd wager there aren't more than a couple dozen pages where I could have used more room.</p>
<p>What this all means is that I have not learned my lesson and will be once again diving right into the plans to use the Techo for everything. The difference this time is that I'm not going to worry about running out of room. I hope that will mean that I do run out of room, because wouldn't that be awesome.</p>

	<p>I bought my first Leica, an M6 TTL in 2004. I've bought and sold a number of them since then. I currently own an M3, M6, MP, Q2 Monochrom, and SL2-S. In the above timeline, film cameras are green and digital cameras are yellow. Can you spot which type I tend to keep longer? The dates should be mostly accurate. There are some conflicting notes on my old blog, but they occur in 2012 which is the year I really messed things up during a platform change, so I've used my Lightroom catalog and Flickr data when in doubt. I also have some notes suggesting that I've owned two Leica M7s but I don't remember that at all.</p>
<p>The future for me probably holds a beat-up original M10 at some point after the M11 is released. Prices should get more reasonable then. I'll probably end up selling the M6 to fund it or something like it. Or maybe I'll sell the MP one day, although the thought makes me shudder. I've had friends say to me, "Never sell a Leica. You always regret selling a Leica." I should probably heed their advice.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2021/12/30/Weight-logging-with-Tind.html">Weight logging with Tinderbox</a></h3>

<section>


	<img src="/img/small/tinderboxicon.png" alt="Weight logging with Tinderbox" class="sideImage">

	<p><i>Note: This was originally posted over at <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> but I thought it belonged here instead</i>.</p>
<p>I kept a “daybook” using <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> for years. I drifted away from Tinderbox for a while after becoming infatuated with Linux or iOS or other “cross-platform” systems. Right now, I’m back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>While rebuilding my Daybook, I wanted to make logging my weight easier. It’s not like it was difficult, but I wanted to tweak it.</p>
<p>Tinderbox is an outliner, so my weight entries are collected under a “Weight Log” node. It looked like this (I obviously wasn’t consistent with tracking last year).</p>
<img src="/img/2021/20211230-weight-log.png">
<p>The weight is stored in a numeric User Attribute called, surprisingly, “Weight”. The outline shows a custom “DisplayFormat” so that it reads nicely:</p>
<p><code>$Weight + " pounds on " + format($StartDate,"MM D")</code></p>
<p>To enter a new weight, I’d select an existing item in the outline, hit Return to create a new note, type in the weight, hit Return to save the note, then use the mouse to click the “Weight” attribute and re-enter the weight there. So much clicking!  😀.</p>
<p>What I wanted to do was to type the weight once in the note’s Name and have the Weight attribute populated automatically. Tinderbox notes can have “Rules” which are commands that run periodically and can update a note’s attributes based on just about any criteria. I could have created a rule that set the Weight based on the Name, but that seemed like overkill since this only ever needs to happen once per note.</p>
<p>With some help from Michael Becker, I think I’ve got it. (You should check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQCp8tVRJSg&list=PL6MVDtSfcKxd2XLpenMAd9H4VknDyn6oz">video series on Mastering Tinderbox</a> for all sorts of great Tinderbox content.)</p>
<p>There’s an OnAdd action which sets the Prototype, Date, and Name of the note. (Setting the Name of the new note to “Enter Weight” is a nice touch.)</p>
<p><code>$Prototype="pWeightLogEntry";$Date|=date(today);if($Name=="untitled"){$Name="Enter Weight"};</code></p>
<p>Then, the new note gets a Rule (via the pWeightLogEntry Prototype) which sets the Weight attribute based on the value of Name:</p>

<code><pre>
$Weight|=$Name;
if($Weight>0){
$Name=$Date("l");
$RuleDisabled=true};</pre></code>

<p>The trick here is setting $RuleDisabled=true. What this does is force the Rule to run only once, which is all I need. I wasn’t aware of the $RuleDisabled attribute, so thanks to Michael for that tip.</p>
<p>Now, to add a new Weight Log entry, I hit Return, type my weight, and hit Return again. Couldn’t be any easier! On my Daybooks “Dashboard” I can graph my weight over time, like so…</p>
<img src="/img/2021/20211230-weight.png">
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with Tinderbox, I’m sorry if I made too many assumptions here. Explaining Tinderbox can be an entire job in itself!</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/30/Shot-2-rolls-of-film.html">#</a></span> <p>I'm reviewing my lens situation. The Leica 35mm Summilux-M ASPH is a pricey lens, so I'm rethinking it. I bought the Summilux for the M10-R, which I've now sold. I figured this was fine, since I could still use it on both the film Ms and the SL2-S. On the other hand, I've really been missing that APO Summicron-SL 35 . I've been considering trading the Summilux M for the Summicron SL. That would leave a 35mm gap in my M kit. Since it's film, I can get away with a Zeiss or Voigtlander, right? So I shot a roll with the 50mm Summilux-M and then with the 35 to see how they feel on film. Well, they're both terrific. So now I don't know what to do. For now, I'm just going to shoot more and ignore the entire problem.</p>

<p>Good morning. It's 4:25 am and let's try and not waste an entire day. <i>Another</i> entire day.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/29/Tinderbox-Watch-Folders.html">#</a></span> <p><a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> has a feature that watches a folder in the Finder, Apple Notes, <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DEVONthink</a>, and even <a href="https://tot.rocks">Tot</a>. It doesn't sync both ways, but it will import new notes from within those watched places and make new notes in a Tinderbox outline. This makes it easy to add notes to my Tinderbox file from a phone or iPad. It wouldn't be too much trouble to just copy and paste, but watched folders make it even easier.</p>

	<p>I have a top-level Agent in my Tinderbox daybook named "Today". All it does is collect notes using a <code>$Date=date(today);</code> query.  Given that I'm putting both blog content and personal logging into the document, the Today container is a handy way to see everything going on today. I'll probably modify it to use a date attribute so I can easily jump to any day and see what I wrote then. Neat.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: I did change the agent query to use my $Date attribute, like this:</p>
<p><code>$Date=$Date(agent);</code></p>
<p>I also changed the agent's $DisplayExpression to reflect the day: </p>
<p><code>"Created " + if($Date==date(today)){"Today"} else {$Date.format("l");}</code></p>
<p>So now I just set the $Date attribute of the "Today" agent to any date and it collects all the dated content created that day.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/29/Fixed-RSS-date.html">#</a></span> <p>I think I've fixed the RSS feed's date. The feed template didn't have a "pubDate" element at all. This probably happened when changing the feed template to do daily posts instead of one item per post. Anyway, sorry about that. Let me know if anything looks amiss.</p>

You know how people dismiss spending $5 for an app, since "it costs the same as a Starbucks coffee."? Well, I like to think of Tinderbox as no more expensive than buying tickets to a play...a really good play that performs continually all day, every day, and helps me get stuff done and stay organized and publish a blog and...and...and. It's actually cheap, when you think of it that way. 😀 <a href="https://fondoftea.com/#2021-12-29%20-%20Wednesday">Alex's note</a> made me think of this.</p>

</figure>


	<p>I'm rebuilding my Tinderbox "Dashboard" for the new year. I neglected the whole Daybook last year but I'm determined to not let that happen this year.</p>
<p>The dashboard is a Tinderbox "Map" view littered with agents showing various summary and aggregate information from the entire document.</p>
<p>In the "Days remaining this year" note, I used to only show the resulting integer. I'd forgotten that in map view, notes can visually plot the values of various attributes (as in the Weight Graph, shown). The note's edict (an edict is like a rule, but runs less often) sets the note's $Subtitle to the number of days remaining in the year, like so:</p>
<p><code>$Subtitle=days(date("today"),date("12/31/2021 6:00 PM"))</code></p>
<p>I cheated in the screenshot using "42" because with only 2 days left this year, it doesn't make for a great demo. The inspector for that note looks like this:</p>
<img src="/img/2021/20211229-inspector.png">
<p>The note uses the built-in "Dashboard" prototype to make things prettier.</p>
<p>The note's $DisplayExpression is simply <code>$Name + ": " + $Subtitle</code></p>
<p>Neat, eh?</p>
