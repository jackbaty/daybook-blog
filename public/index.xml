<p>Good morning. It's 4:25 am and let's try and not waste an entire day. <i>Another</i> entire day.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/29/Tinderbox-Watch-Folders.html">#</a></span> <p><a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> has a feature that watches a folder in the Finder, Apple Notes, <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DEVONthink</a>, and even <a href="https://tot.rocks">Tot</a>. It doesn't sync both ways, but it will import new notes from within those watched places and make new notes in a Tinderbox outline. This makes it easy to add notes to my Tinderbox file from a phone or iPad. It wouldn't be too much trouble to just copy and paste, but watched folders make it even easier.</p> 

</div>

	<p>I have a top-level Agent in my Tinderbox daybook named "Today". All it does is collect notes using a <code>$Date=date(today);</code> query.  Given that I'm putting both blog content and personal logging into the document, the Today container is a handy way to see everything going on today. I'll probably modify it to use a date attribute so I can easily jump to any day and see what I wrote then. Neat.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/29/Fixed-RSS-date.html">#</a></span> <p>I think I've fixed the RSS feed's date. The feed template didn't have a "pubDate" element at all. This probably happened when changing the feed template to do daily posts instead of one item per post. Anyway, sorry about that. Let me know if anything looks amiss.</p>

You know how people dismiss spending $5 for an app, since "it costs the same as a Starbucks coffee."? Well, I like to think of Tinderbox as no more expensive than buying tickets to a really good play...a play that performs all day, every day, and helps me get stuff done and stay organized and publish a blog and...and...and. It's actually cheap, when you think of it that way. 😀</p>

</figure>


	<p>I've used some version of Leica M camera since 2004. I love them so much that I recently purchased a brand new MP film camera, which is awesome. Only a month ago, I was finally able to get the latest digital M, the M10-R. Surprisingly, I didn't love it. I wanted to love it. I <i>thought</i> I'd love it. I didn't. </p>
<p>The M10-R was going to be my everyday carry camera. That didn't work out. </p>
<p>The M is a slow, manual-focus, deliberate camera. It's not really suited for just having around taking snaps. It only focuses down to like three feet. Manual focus means that every shot requires two hands. It's very very expensive, so letting it just dangle around my neck while not paying attention to it is a terrible idea. I love the <i>idea</i> of a digital M, but the execution leaves me wanting.</p>
<p>So I'm going back to a Q2 Monochrom :).</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/27/I-like-sitting-here-and-.html">#</a></span> <p>At times, I feel embarrassed about sitting here and writing for so long every day. There are so many other, more "productive" things I could (should?) be doing. But I love doing this. I love writing and sharing the things I'm thinking about. I love sitting in front of this beautiful monitor with this amazing keyboard attached to the best computer I've ever owned, and just typing.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/27/I-want-only-one-blog.html">#</a></span> <p>I want only one blog. How the hell will I ever make that happen? Tinderbox is awesome but blogging with it requires a lot of setup and probably long-term fiddling. WordPress can do anything but feels clumsy. Ghost is slick and fast but feels focused on "building an audience" and doesn't have comments or stats. Hugo is cool and fast and I get to use Emacs, but it's also very <i>separate</i> from the actual rendered content. TiddlyWiki isn't for blogging, even though it can be coerced into it. I'll never be able to choose just one option and stick with it for more than, say 72 hours. For example right now I have 3 of my sites loaded in tabs and am weighing pros and cons of each and determining if any of them could be The One. I hate this.</p>
<p>...1 hour later...</p>
<p>I think I'll focus on <a href="https://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> for now. I'm also considering either copying these daily notes into a daily post on <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>, or not publishing to the daily blog at all. I'll just use Tinderbox for writing and organizing, then use WordPress for publishing. I do like the <a href="http://daily.baty.net">daily.baty.net</a> blog output, though. But do I want to keep working at it so hard?</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/27/I-got-to-use-my-new-snow.html">#</a></span> <p>It snowed overnight, so I finally got to use my new snowblower. Worked like butter. Clearing the driveway is now basically just walking back and forth for a few minutes.</p> 

</div>






<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/27/About-that-M10-R.html">#</a></span> <p>I continue to feel that perhaps the Leica M10-R is not the right camera for the way I take photos. This disturbs me a little, because I <i>want</i> it to be The One.</p>
<p>I've boxed up the camera and plan to list it on <a href="http://fredmiranda.com">fredmiranda.com</a> later today. Let's see if I chicken out again.</p>
<p>Update: It's for sale: <a href="https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1734952/0?nc=1#15809485">https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1734952/0?nc=1#15809485</a></p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/27/DEVONthink-is-back.html">#</a></span> <p>I didn't think I'd want to install DEVONthink on my new Mac. I've been all "but files and folders can do everything!" I was wrong. DTP makes collecting, storing, organizing, and analyzing files and text so easy that I feel like I still need it. Maybe not "need", but definitely <i>want</i>.</p>

<p>Somehow, some part of their attention is directed toward the possibility that their application environment isn't "ideal." They have this notion there's some perfect writing environment that will make them more productive or better writers by eliminating this thing called "distraction." There's some anxiety about the tool they're using.</p>

<p>Dave's right. I've gone through many iterations around "distraction-free" writing myself. In my case, though, I don't do it because I feel the writing environment is holding me back. I do it because it can be fun to twiddle with tools. Same with cameras. My cameras have been better than my ability for years, but I still keep trying new cameras because I love cameras.</p>
<p>Oh, and about distraction-free writing in Tinderbox, I wrote <a href="https://archive.baty.net/2012/tinderbox-as-a-minimalist-writing-environment/">Tinderbox as a Minimalist Writing Environment</a> in 2013. (Unfortunately, all of the site's images from 2012 were lost during one of many platform migrations.)</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/26/Speaking-of-distractions.html">#</a></span> <p>This week started out with the intention of building a Rails app, but ended with the creation of an entirely new Tinderbox Daybook and blogging system. You're soaking in it. I'm still considering moving the whole enterprise to baty.blog and just living with that for a while. However, I still wonder about returning it to <a href="http://rudimentarylathe.org">rudimentarylathe.org</a> or maybe even replacing the photography domain <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>. And who knows, I may end with all of this back in Emacs in a month. But Tinderbox is still super fun and powerful and let's try it!</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/26/Note-icons-on-the-archiv.html">#</a></span> <p>Tinderbox does this cool thing in outlines where the icon changes based on the age and size of each note. I'm working on mimicking that feature on the <a href="archives.html">Archives</a> page here. I'm a little lost when it comes to the new "functions" features in Tinderbox 9.1 so I fell back to adding some Action code as an Edict. Like this...</p>

<pre>
if ($TextLength>500) {
    	$NoteIcon="long.png";
}
if ($TextLength>50 & $TextLength<=500) {
    	$NoteIcon ="medium.png";

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/25/It-s-Christmas.html">#</a></span> <p>Good morning. It's 4:35 am on Christmas morning. It'll be nice just hanging out with the family today, but with no young children around, Christmas doesn't have the magic it once did. I'm not a religious person, so Christmas is not much more than a thinly-veiled celebration of consumerism. The lights are pretty, and the food is good, though. Everyone will be up and around before long and I'll get into the swing of things soon enough.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2021/12/25/Trying-a-new-app-tap.html">Trying a new app, /tap</a></h3>

<section>

</figure>


	<p>I learned about a new note-taking app, <a href="https://www.tatatap.com">/tap</a>, so of course I gave it a spin.  /tap is about creating short, "smart" notes. "Bite-size notes with special stuff."</p>
<p>Most of the interaction with /tap is done via typing. So you can put a note in the "to-read" folder by starting the note with "<code>/to-read</code>". There's <code>#tagging</code> also. It gets fun when adding "events" and "beans". An event tracks things that happen each day. Good for tracking, say, meditation or workouts. Beans are simple counters. Add beans with "<code>+mybean:10</code>", for example. Events and Beans are tracked separately and can be seen in special views by date or by account. </p>
<p>/tap is a simple but clever app with some fun ideas. I love its simple, sparse design. /tap is a web app and costs $7/month. This comes with the usual concerns about privacy and longevity, but for some it might be just the ticket.</p>

So much for my dream of maintaining just one site for everything. And Coping Mechanism is still out there, even though I've had a TODO in my inbox for a which which says, "Delete the <a href="https://baty.blog">Copingmechanism.com</a> instance." The idea was to use this site instead of the wiki for daily notes, and baty.blog for everything else. But then just this morning I wrote what could be considered a "real" blog post with <a href="posts/2021/12/25/Trying-a-new-app-tap.html">Trying a new app, /tap</a>. Shouldn't that go on the blog?

The photographer(s) are unknown, but most of the images were taken in and around Grand Rapids, MI sometime during the first couple of decades of the 20th century. Just look at all the fun happening in this image. The kid on the rope swing. The young woman about to dive into the river. The gathering of boys on the bank, watching. The bicycle. I just love it!</p>

<p>I miss this style of UI design very much — not the exact look, per se, but the spirit of emphasizing clarity above all else, where content fields are clearly content fields, input focus is clear, and buttons look like buttons.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/23/Again-with-Tinderbox.html">#</a></span> <p>Funny that Alex mentions Tinderbox, since I’ve been keeping up with my Tinderbox Daybook for a week or so. And I also posted again to notes.baty.net, which is built using Tinderbox, just for fun. The scary part is that I started thinking about combining the notes blog and my daybook into one giant Tinderbox document for 2022. How cool would it be to have all my stuff in one place (that’s not Emacs)? It solves the related problem of public vs private notes. Using Tinderbox makes it easy to publish only what I want, where I want. I can also pull in parts of private outlines and notes into the published areas. Hmmm.</p>

<p>That does it. I’m creating a brand new Tinderbox document with the intention of combining my Daybook and Blog documents for 2022. This will work nicely as a way to avoid doing anything actually useful today.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/08/Remember-this-.html">#</a></span> <p>Alex reminded me about this blog, so I just had to open Tinderbox and play with it. I don't know if it will go anywhere, since I'm in the middle of another "where do I post stuff!?" crisis. This, though, remains an option.</p>
<p>Is it funny that I don't even remember where this site is hosted? Maybe not "funny" so much as symptomatic of the entire problem. Update: It's using <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/11/24/Today.html">#</a></span> <p>There are several ways to approach images in ox-hugo. I’m trying three of them in this post :). First, I drag and drop an image into the buffer and it’s automatically, via org-attach, moved into ./attach/XX/UUIDfilename.jpg. A link is inserted and when rendering markdown, it uses Hugo’s “figure” short code. This is the easiest option to do, but has the most moving parts. I don’t like that I don’t have control over the precise path. Second, I just link to the URL of an image in SmugMug. Super easy, but I do have to upload the image then grab the “share” link. Not bad. The third option is to generate a local file link like [[img/foo.jpg]]. This feels the most self-contained and tidy, but means exporting a specifically-sized image, naming it something, copying that name, and moving it into the static/img/etc. folder. I’ll probably try all three ways for a bit to see which feels best.</p>
<p>I’ve been having a lot of fun in the darkroom lately.</p>

<p>Blogging with Drummer feels like using someone else’s bathroom. I really have to go, and it’s a nice bathroom, but it’s not mine and I can’t really relax, ya know</p>
