<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/27/I-like-sitting-here-and-.html">#</a></span> <p>At times, I feel embarrassed about sitting here and writing for so long every day. There are so many other, more "productive" things I could (should?) be doing. But I love doing this. I love writing and sharing the things I'm thinking about. I love sitting in front of this beautiful monitor with this amazing keyboard attached to the best computer I've ever owned, and just typing.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/27/I-want-only-one-blog.html">#</a></span> <p>I want only one blog. How the hell will I ever make that happen? Tinderbox is awesome but blogging with it requires a lot of setup and probably long-term fiddling. WordPress can do anything but feels clumsy. Ghost is slick and fast but feels focused on "building an audience" and doesn't have comments or stats. Hugo is cool and fast and I get to use Emacs, but it's also very <i>separate</i> from the actual rendered content. TiddlyWiki isn't for blogging, even though it can be coerced into it. I'll never be able to choose just one option and stick with it for more than, say 72 hours. For example right now I have 3 of my sites loaded in tabs and am weighing pros and cons of each and determining if any of them could be The One. I hate this.</p>
<p>...1 hour later...</p>
<p>I think I'll focus on <a href="https://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> for now. I'm also considering either copying these daily notes into a daily post on <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>, or not publishing to the daily blog at all. I'll just use Tinderbox for writing and organizing, then use WordPress for publishing. I do like the <a href="http://daily.baty.net">daily.baty.net</a> blog output, though. But do I want to keep working at it so hard?</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/27/About-that-M10-R.html">#</a></span> <p>I continue to feel that perhaps the Leica M10-R is not the right camera for the way I take photos. This disturbs me a little, because I <i>want</i> it to be The One.</p>
<p>I've boxed up the camera and plan to list it on <a href="http://fredmiranda.com">fredmiranda.com</a> later today. Let's see if I chicken out again.</p>
<p>Update: It's for sale: <a href="https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1734952/0?nc=1#15809485">https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1734952/0?nc=1#15809485</a></p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/27/DEVONthink-is-back.html">#</a></span> <p>I didn't think I'd want to install DEVONthink on my new Mac. I've been all "but files and folders can do everything!" I was wrong. DTP makes collecting, storing, organizing, and analyzing files and text so easy that I feel like I still need it. Maybe not "need", but definitely <i>want</i>.</p>

<p>Somehow, some part of their attention is directed toward the possibility that their application environment isn't "ideal." They have this notion there's some perfect writing environment that will make them more productive or better writers by eliminating this thing called "distraction." There's some anxiety about the tool they're using.</p>

</blockquote><script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>
<p>Dave's right. I've gone through many iterations around "distraction-free" writing myself. In my case, though, I don't do it because I feel the writing environment is holding me back. I do it because it can be fun to twiddle with tools. Same with cameras. My cameras have been better than my ability for years, but I still keep trying new cameras because I love cameras.</p>
<p>Oh, and about distraction-free writing in Tinderbox, I wrote <a href="https://archive.baty.net/2012/tinderbox-as-a-minimalist-writing-environment/">Tinderbox as a Minimalist Writing Environment</a> in 2013. (Unfortunately, all of the site's images from 2012 were lost during one of many platform migrations.)</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/26/Speaking-of-distractions.html">#</a></span> <p>This week started out with the intention of building a Rails app, but ended with the creation of an entirely new Tinderbox Daybook and blogging system. You're soaking in it. I'm still considering moving the whole enterprise to baty.blog and just living with that for a while. However, I still wonder about returning it to <a href="http://rudimentarylathe.org">rudimentarylathe.org</a> or maybe even replacing the photography domain <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a>. And who knows, I may end with all of this back in Emacs in a month. But Tinderbox is still super fun and powerful and let's try it!</p>

<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/26/Note-icons-on-the-archiv.html">#</a></span> <p>Tinderbox does this cool thing in outlines where the icon changes based on the age and size of each note. I'm working on mimicking that feature on the <a href="archives.html">Archives</a> page here. I'm a little lost when it comes to the new "functions" features in Tinderbox 9.1 so I fell back to adding some Action code as an Edict. Like this...</p>

<pre>
if ($TextLength>500) {
    	$NoteIcon="long.png";
}
if ($TextLength>50 & $TextLength<=500) {
    	$NoteIcon ="medium.png";
}
if ($TextLength<50) {
	$NoteIcon ="small.png";
}
if ($Image) {$NoteIcon = "cam.png"};

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/25/It-s-Christmas.html">#</a></span> <p>Good morning. It's 4:35 am on Christmas morning. It'll be nice just hanging out with the family today, but with no young children around, Christmas doesn't have the magic it once did. I'm not a religious person, so Christmas is not much more than a thinly-veiled celebration of consumerism. The lights are pretty, and the food is good, though. Everyone will be up and around before long and I'll get into the swing of things soon enough.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2021/12/25/Trying-a-new-app-tap.html">Trying a new app, /tap</a></h3>

<section>

</figure>


	<p>I learned about a new note-taking app, <a href="https://www.tatatap.com">/tap</a>, so of course I gave it a spin.  /tap is about creating short, "smart" notes. "Bite-size notes with special stuff."</p>
<p>Most of the interaction with /tap is done via typing. So you can put a note in the "to-read" folder by starting the note with "<code>/to-read</code>". There's <code>#tagging</code> also. It gets fun when adding "events" and "beans". An event tracks things that happen each day. Good for tracking, say, meditation or workouts. Beans are simple counters. Add beans with "<code>+mybean:10</code>", for example. Events and Beans are tracked separately and can be seen in special views by date or by account. </p>
<p>/tap is a simple but clever app with some fun ideas. I love its simple, sparse design. /tap is a web app and costs $7/month. This comes with the usual concerns about privacy and longevity, but for some it might be just the ticket.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/25/Should-this-site-be-at-b.html">#</a></span> <p>I'm still working through the differences between this site and the blog at baty.blog. So much for my dream of maintaining just one site for everything. And Coping Mechanism is still out there, even though I've had a TODO in my inbox for a which which says, "Delete the <a href="https://baty.blog">Copingmechanism.com</a> instance." The idea was to use this site instead of the wiki for daily notes, and baty.blog for everything else. But then just this morning I wrote what could be considered a "real" blog post with <a href="posts/2021/12/25/Trying-a-new-app-tap.html">Trying a new app, /tap</a>. Shouldn't that go on the blog? Probably, but I was already here, if you know what I mean. Sigh. Still noodlin'.</p>

The photographer(s) are unknown, but most of the images were taken in and around Grand Rapids, MI sometime during the first couple of decades of the 20th century. Just look at all the fun happening in this image. The kid on the rope swing. The young woman about to dive into the river. The gathering of boys on the bank, watching. The bicycle. I just love it!</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/23/Again-with-Tinderbox.html">#</a></span> <p>Funny that Alex mentions Tinderbox, since I’ve been keeping up with my Tinderbox Daybook for a week or so. And I also posted again to notes.baty.net, which is built using Tinderbox, just for fun. The scary part is that I started thinking about combining the notes blog and my daybook into one giant Tinderbox document for 2022. How cool would it be to have all my stuff in one place (that’s not Emacs)? It solves the related problem of public vs private notes. Using Tinderbox makes it easy to publish only what I want, where I want. I can also pull in parts of private outlines and notes into the published areas. Hmmm.</p>

<p>That does it. I’m creating a brand new Tinderbox document with the intention of combining my Daybook and Blog documents for 2022. This will work nicely as a way to avoid doing anything actually useful today.</p>

<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/11/24/Today.html">#</a></span> <p>There are several ways to approach images in ox-hugo. I’m trying three of them in this post :). First, I drag and drop an image into the buffer and it’s automatically, via org-attach, moved into ./attach/XX/UUIDfilename.jpg. A link is inserted and when rendering markdown, it uses Hugo’s “figure” short code. This is the easiest option to do, but has the most moving parts. I don’t like that I don’t have control over the precise path. Second, I just link to the URL of an image in SmugMug. Super easy, but I do have to upload the image then grab the “share” link. Not bad. The third option is to generate a local file link like [[img/foo.jpg]]. This feels the most self-contained and tidy, but means exporting a specifically-sized image, naming it something, copying that name, and moving it into the static/img/etc. folder. I’ll probably try all three ways for a bit to see which feels best.</p>
<p>I’ve been having a lot of fun in the darkroom lately.</p>

<p>Blogging with Drummer feels like using someone else’s bathroom. I really have to go, and it’s a nice bathroom, but it’s not mine and I can’t really relax, ya know</p>

<p>I needed to run some errands yesterday and happened to drive by <a href="https://www.schulerbooks.com/">Schuler Books</a>, an independent store based in Michigan and one I've been going to for decades.</p>
<p>It's been a couple of years since I've been inside a bookstore and oh my goodness what a feeling. Am I the only one that feels a certain calming wonder upon entering any bookstore? Maybe not the giant chain stores because they feel a little yucky to me and it takes the fun out of it, but the local(ish) stores that have been in the neighborhood forever. Mmmm.</p>
<p>Shopping for books by walking around amongst the shelves is an immeasurably better experience than endlessly clicking on the computer. The only reviews to be had are a few hand-written notes in front of some books. One per book. No aggregated score. No algorithm. No ads.</p>
<p>I bought the <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/termination-shock-9780063028050/9780063028050">new Neal Stephenson book</a> (which is honestly why I was there in the first place). But I also bought <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-ten-thousand-doors-of-january-9780316421997/9780316421973">The Ten Thousand Doors of January</a> and a <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-selected-poetry-of-rainer-maria-rilke-bilingual-edition/9780679722014">book of poetry by Rilke</a>. During checkout, they said that they loved the Rilke book and how it included the original German-language versions. They then inserted a bookmark in each book, and packed them all into a crisp paper bag and said, "Enjoy!"</p>

<p>Bookstores are the best.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/11/18/No-news-is-good-news.html">#</a></span> <p>I have been avoiding news sites, mostly successfully, for a while now. Life is better without knowing about things I neither care nor can do anything about. The Economist once a week is enough. When I do accidentally dip into NYT or similar, I am reminded that the Bad Guys really are winning and it depresses me to no end.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/11/18/About-that-M10-Monochrom.html">#</a></span> <p>I've been thinking a lot lately about getting a Leica M10 Monochrom. I know, I know, it's a bad idea. I had the Leica Q2 Monochrom and sold it. But but but! The idea is that if I consider myself a primarily black and white photographer, and I do, there's nothing better than the M10M. Except it's way too expensive for something so limited. Then I had a genius idea. What about an M10-P again? But, and here's the genius part, set up Lightroom to convert raw images to black and white on import! That way I never have to actually see each image in color and decide if I should convert it to black and white. It's darn close to shooting B&W right in the camera. Later, if I do happen to get curious, I can peek at the original color version, just in case. Ha? Ya?</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/11/18/Social-features.html">#</a></span> <p>Adding social or collaborative features to an app invariably makes that app worse. (Unless of course that's what the app is <i>for</i>)</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/11/18/Three-years-at-the-Lathe.html">#</a></span> <p>I've been writing in my wiki at <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.wiki">rudimentarylathe.wiki</a> for over three years. It now contains 2766 "tiddlers". That's the longest I've stuck with any platform in as long as I can remember. I often think about moving to something newer or prettier or whatever, but in short order I'm back in TiddlyWiki. It's comfortable.</p>
