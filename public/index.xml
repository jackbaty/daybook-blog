<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/03/05/notes-baty-net.html">#</a></span> <p>I keep telling myself I'm never again going to change the domain name on an establishes website. And yet, I moved this Tinderbox-generated site from <a href="http://notes.baty.net">notes.baty.net</a> to <a href="http://daily.baty.net">daily.baty.net</a> to <a href="http://tb.baty.net">tb.baty.net</a> and now back to <a href="http://notes.baty.net">notes.baty.net</a>. Let's leave it alone now, m'kay? (It'll be broken there until DNS catches up.)</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/03/05/Plain-text-files.html">#</a></span> <p>I wrote a little about plain text files</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, back up those Word docs and PDFs and Mindmaps and Powerpoints. And back up your plain text files, too. At least that way you stand a chance of having them ‚Äúsomeday in the future‚Äù. You can worry about how to open them then.</p>

	<h3><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/03/05/What-if-I-used-Tinderbox.html">What if I used Tinderbox to generate Hugo-compatible Markdown files?</a></h3>

	<img src="https://notes.baty.net/img/small/tinderboxicon.png" alt="What if I used Tinderbox to generate Hugo-compatible Markdown files?" class="sideImage">

	<p>I'm <a href="posts/2022/02/28/Good-morning.html">still thinking about this</a>.</p>
<p>The tricky part with using Tinderbox to generate websites is that the export features are almost too powerful and configurable. I've gotten things arranged the way I want them here, but it feels fragile. I hesitate to tweak any of the templates for fear of breaking the site.</p>
<p>What if, instead of exporting HTML files from Tinderbox, I export Hugo-compatible Markdown files? I could use Tinderbox as the authoring, organizing, and linking environment, and then let Hugo generate the actual website.</p>
<p>The upside is that Hugo templates are <i>made</i> for creating websites/blogs. All the tagging, markup, RSS feeds, and other bloggy stuff is already built. And I can use any of the many nice themes instead of this cobbled thing I'm using now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's a pretty big moving part. And is generating Markdown any simpler than HTML? Do I end up with the same fragile process, <i>plus</i> the need for Hugo?</p>

<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/02/28/This-could-almost-be-a-m.html">#</a></span> <p>I canceled my Micro.blog subscription today. It's only $5/month but it costs me a lot in mental overhead. I don't feel like I need a microblog. I can just use Twitter or Mastodon. Or really, this site could be a sort of microblog, no?</p>

<p>And why not? It looks good enough. It's fun to make. It lets me use Tinderbox. What more do I want?</p>

I'm still mostly at Write.as/jackbaty and Rudimentarylathe.wiki right now, but who knows when or if I'll decide that Tinderbox is once again the right way to manage and publish my notes?</p>

<p>Just missing Tinderbox after my recent foray into Linux. I'm still blogging primarily at <a href="https://baty.blog">baty.blog</a>, but it's nice to say "hello" here once in a while.</p> 

</div>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/02/04/Am-I-bored-yet-.html">#</a></span> <p>My wife asked me if I was getting bored with not working. Fair question! The answer is that, no, I'm not getting bored. But I am getting restless.</p>

<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/17/Good-morning.html">#</a></span> <p>It's 4:15 am and I'm pretty sure I'm not getting enough sleep.</p> 

</div>






<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/17/What-do-I-get-in-return-.html">#</a></span> <p>What do I get in return for all the time and thought I put into taking notes? I mean, I put a <i>lot</i> of thought into it. What's in it for me? I've been meticulously recording my meals since December. I can tell you how many times I ate fast food or had pancakes for breakfast. Big whoop! There is almost zero lingering value in doing it other than that it's neat. Is "neat" enough to justify the effort it took to set up the logging process and the ongoing effort of recording every meal? It's fun to set up, but if I'm honest, it's not useful. I don't need more excuses to play with my note-taking tools. I should stop doing it.</p>

<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/17/Wireless-things-stop-wor.html">#</a></span> <p>Wireless things always stop working eventually.</p>

<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/17/Engage-.html">#</a></span> <p>It's so prevalent that it mostly goes unnoticed, but the entire internet is a cacophony of people and companies yelling,  "Please engage with me!"</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/16/We-cannot-know-what-moti.html">#</a></span> <p>A frequent mistake we make is to believe that we can know the intentions of others.</p>

<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/16/Using-what-I-have.html">#</a></span> <p>After spending a week getting this Tinderbox-generated blog configured just so, I started tinkering with Emacs and ox-hugo again yesterday. Why? I think instead I should use what I have. It's pretty dialed in, so run with it, ok?</p> 

</div>






<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/16/Two-hours-a-day-.html">#</a></span> <p>What would I do with my time if I only allowed myself two hours at the computer each day? I'm afraid to find out. Or, perhaps more accurately, I'm afraid to try.¬†</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/16/Sensor-cleaning.html">#</a></span> <p>I recently (accidentally) spit on my SL2-S's sensor while trying to blow some dust off it. (Don't do that). The first swab cleaning didn't remove the smudges. I just tried again, and really "dug in there" with the swab. It worked. Whew! That was scary.</p>

<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/16/Vehicles-for-creativity.html">#</a></span> <p>I am surrounded by creative vehicles: Cameras, film, paint supplies, drawing tools, notebooks, pens, a darkroom, typewriters, and so on. They all spend most of the time either parked or up on blocks. To continue stretching the metaphor...I should just hop in and drive.</p> 

</div>






<div class="postNoTitle">


<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/16/A-deliberate-lack-of-rig.html">#</a></span> <p>I'm learning that I avoid anything that requires a significant amount of rigor. A deliberate lack of rigor is more my style.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/15/Good-morning.html">#</a></span> <p>Good morning, we're halfway through January already. The Tempus, she sure Fugits doesn't she? Let's start your day with a photo of me from a few years ago. Note that this was not some sort of costume. I actually walked around Busch Gardens looking like this.<p></p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="https://notes.baty.net/posts/2022/01/15/From-Readwise-to-org-roa.html">#</a></span> <p>Yesterday, I canceled my <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> subscription because, although it's cool, I wasn't getting much tangible value from it. Today, I discovered  <code>org-roam-node-random</code>  and it's kind of good enough as a replacement.</p>

<p>This is an example of how Org-roam will evolve. It always begins with a personal experiment based on literature, and once I‚Äôve concluded that it works, I extract it in its minimal form and make it available for all to use.</p>
