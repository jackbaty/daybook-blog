	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/08/Shooting-film-when-I-m-i.html">Shooting film when I'm in the mood</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>Over the past several years, my interest in shooting film has regularly ebbed and flowed. This fluctuation wouldn't be a problem if the frequency and amplitude weren't so high. My brain does this thing where it decides, usually after a successful roll or inspiring blog post, that I'm now going to "shoot only film from now on!" This is immediately followed by the purchase of supporting cameras or other gear.</p>
<p>A short time later, I tire of waiting to finish a roll, even though when I'm in film mode I claim that "waiting is a feature". The digital cameras come out and I start wondering why I bother with the hassle of film, when digital is "better", faster, and cheaper. I should sell off most of the film gear, shutter the darkroom, and just learn how to make decent inkjet prints instead.</p>
<p>And then, I finally finish that roll, process it, scan it, and make a couple of darkroom prints. Wow! This is so cool and fun and I love the images and I love having the negatives neatly organized in binders on my shelves for future generations of scholars and historians. (ha!).</p>
<p>So, what I'm saying is that I enjoy both film and digital. I should learn that about myself. I should build processes around both, as needed, and stop trying to decide which I want to do exclusively and realize that it all depends upon my mood.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/08/Leica-M11-speculation.html">#</a></span> <p>Given that the <a href="https://hmeye.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/open-leica_m11_technical_data_en.pdf">spec sheet of the new Leica M11</a> has been leaked a week early, I thought I'd check out the Leica forums. I recently sold my M10-R, so of course I'm interested in what's next for Leica. My god, how I hate speculation. The discussions are boring and useless and I'm going to stop reading them. The good news is that, based on the specs, I see no pressing need for owning an M11. </p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/07/Photo-processing-workflo.html">Photo processing workflow update, Jan 2022</a></h3>

<section>


	<img src="https://daily.baty.net/img/small//img/small/photomechanic.png" alt="Photo processing workflow update, Jan 2022" class="sideImage">

	<p>TL;DR: I'm back to a combination of <a href="https://www.captureone.com/en">Capture One Pro</a> and <a href="https://home.camerabits.com/tour-photo-mechanic/">Photo Mechanic Plus</a>, with a dash of Apple Photos.</p>
<p>I continue to waffle on which app to use for which portion of my photography workflow. Most recently, I'd considered <a href="posts/2022/01/03/Apple-Photos-vs-Lightroo.html">Apple Photos vs Lightroom Classic as photo library</a>. This was fueled by my desire to keep my library and my editing tool separate. LrC is probably the best all-around solution, and is the closest thing we have to an "industry standard". But, I prefer Capture One Pro for RAW processing. </p>
<p>Capture One's catalog is mediocre, so I've built a new catalog of all my photos using  Photo Mechanic (Plus). This lets me work with "Sessions" in C1, which I much prefer. I wish PM's UI for browsing its catalog was prettier, even if that meant it was less powerful. Still, it's quite fast and powerful.</p>
<p>Apple Photos is great for sharing and just having my photos with me on all devices, so I've added "Export to Apple Photos" as a final step.</p>
<p>Here's my current workflow for digital camera images.</p>
<p>In Capture One:</p>
<ul><li> Import from card into Capture One session's Import folder</li>
<li> Delete anything I don't like (ruthlessly)</li>
<li> Edit any keepers</li>
<li> Export a finished JPEG into the same folder as original image</li></ul>
<p>In Photo Mechanic</p>
<ul><li> View the import folder in Photo Mechanic</li>
<li> Rate, keyword, and caption each image</li>
<li> Move all images into dated folders and add to PM catalog</li>
<li> Export full-size version of any starred images to Apple Photos</li>
<li> Share and upload as needed</li></ul>
<p>This means I spend only enough time in Capture One to edit select images and "burn" JPEG copies. Then it's off to Photo Mechanic for metadata and organization. Then out to Apple Photos for sharing with family and any other apps. The "big catalog" is Photo Mechanic.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2022/01/06/Capture-One-Pro.html">#</a></span> <p>Yesterday, at about this time, I said that I wanted to <a href="posts/2022/01/05/Good-morning.html">move my photo editing back to Capture One Pro</a>. I later spent a few hours doing just that. Yes, yes, I know, I do this all the time and always end up back in Lightroom Classic. That may happen again this time, but what I'm always reminded of is that I get photos I like better out of C1 faster and more easily than I do with LrC. And when I want to get fancy, C1 does a better job also (layers!). I almost never drop into Photoshop, but I suppose if I do more "real" portraits, I'll need it for retouching. C1 is just nicer. It's also better when switching between the big and little screens because the layouts are so customizable. I have a custom layout for both screens. Tethering from the Leicas works like butter in C1, too. So, Lightroom has "easier" going for it, but C1 wins at just about everything else.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/06/750-Words.html">750 Words</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>Damn you <a href="https://750words.com">750 Words</a> for importing my old content into <a href="https://new.750words.com">the new site</a>. Now I feel like trying to earn more badges. My best one so far is the Albatross, which signifies a 30-day unbroken writing streak. How did I ever manage to do that? I hate the gamification of things like writing. I hate worrying about "streaks". And yet, it's only three notebook pages, right? And I have all day to do it. Beats wasting my time failing at <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a>.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/04/Big-screens-are-bad-for-.html">Big screens are bad for me</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I use a 32-inch monitor on my desk at home and I love it. I can do one big thing like, say, editing photos with room to spare. Or, I can do a bunch of small things all at once. </p>
<p>It's that second part that gets me. Most of the time I can see the windows of at least a half-dozen different apps at once. This has been causing me some consternation. I find myself flitting about between apps and windows and tasks, simply because I happen to notice something somewhere on the screen.</p>
<p>I've noticed that whenever I detach the MBP and work on only the "little" 14-inch screen, I feel much more focused. Calmer, even. It's happening right now as I type this. The Tinderbox note window I'm typing in takes up most of the screen, leaving me to relax and pay attention to what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Of course it depends on the task. Launching Lightroom Classic is a harsh reminder of the limited the screen real estate here. If I needed an IDE and browser and terminal side-by-side all the time I'd feel cramped. But for general computing stuff, email, blogging, etc. Smaller may be better. </p>
<p>Here's the window size from the MBP after plugging it into the big monitor. You can see why I'd feel cramped.</p>

In recent months, I've come to realize that I almost never need the stuff in my logs when I'm out and about. I <i>worry</i> about needing it, but don't. Most of the things I think I might need are nice-to-haves. There are a few things I do occasionally truly need, so I just keep them in Apple Notes. I think I'm finally learning to tell the difference.</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2022/01/03/Apple-Photos-vs-Lightroo.html">Apple Photos vs Lightroom Classic as photo library</a></h3>

<section>


	<p>I have nearly 100,000 photos in Adobe Lightroom (Classic). Lightroom is only useful on my Mac and is rather clunky to use as a library. The new Lightroom is nicer, and syncs everywhere, but I don't want to rely on Adobe's cloud.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of using Apple Photos as my library. It's on all my devices automatically. It's simple and looks nice enough. Nearly every photo-related app can access the library directly, obviating the need to "share" from app to app. My family uses it, so shared albums are easy for them to find. Plus, it has face and object recognition and really good OS integration. Photos is also the most likely app I'll still be using in 10+ years.</p>
<p>Using Photos means that rather than importing photos taken on my phone into Lightroom, I export photos I've processed with Lightroom into Photos. </p>
<p>The big downside here is that my LrC library only contains locally-imported photos, and my phone contains all my iPhone photos plus just the images I've exported from LrC. I have no one canonical place with <i>everything</i>. I can't decide if this matters.</p>
<p>I could configure Lightroom on my phone to automatically sync photos back into my library, but then I have to be careful about re-importing to Photos so I don't end up with duplicates. This has happened before. </p>
<p>I may also try PhotoSync again to see if I can find a way to have the best of both worlds.</p>

	<p>Publishing this blog using <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> is certainly complex, but is it also too complicated?</p>
<p>There are many moving parts: agents, rules, expressions, action code, attributes, and so on. But to simply publish this post, all I do is hit return, type some words, and click a button. Not complicated at all. However, if I decide to change something, or if I change something by accident, all hell might break loose. </p>
<p>Publishing is simple here, but running the show is pretty complicated. Still, this setup is fun, lightweight, super flexible, and ultimately renders a static site. I'm thinking it's a fair balance.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Dave Rogers<a href="https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2022/January_2022.html#note_798"> posted a note</a> about complexity and Tinderbox and it's made me feel a bit better. His blog, <a href="https://nice-marmot.net">Nice Marmot</a>, is one of the things that inspired me to dive back to Tinderbox for personal blogging. I'm glad I did. Thanks, Dave!</p>

	<p>I bought my first <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/about/">Hobonichi Techo</a> in 2013, and I've used one every year since. One of my favorite things in any new year is copying over events from last year's calendar into the new one. Birthdays, anniversaries, etc. It's a much better feeling than something like waiting for Facebook to tell me when to pay attention to someone.</p>
<p>Another thing I do every January is plan on going all-in with the Techo. Todos, appointments, notes, lists, everything should go in that lovely book with its wonderful Tomoe River paper. But then I worry about it being too small. With big plans to use analog tools even more this year, will the little Hobonichi be too limiting?</p>
<p>The answer to that question has always been, "No." Most of those Techos on my shelf are at least half empty. I'd wager there aren't more than a couple dozen pages where I could have used more room.</p>
<p>What this all means is that I have not learned my lesson and will be once again diving right into the plans to use the Techo for everything. The difference this time is that I'm not going to worry about running out of room. I hope that will mean that I do run out of room, because wouldn't that be awesome.</p>

	<p>I bought my first Leica, an M6 TTL in 2004. I've bought and sold a number of them since then. I currently own an M3, M6, MP, Q2 Monochrom, and SL2-S. In the above timeline, film cameras are green and digital cameras are yellow. Can you spot which type I tend to keep longer? The dates should be mostly accurate. There are some conflicting notes on my old blog, but they occur in 2012 which is the year I really messed things up during a platform change, so I've used my Lightroom catalog and Flickr data when in doubt. I also have some notes suggesting that I've owned two Leica M7s but I don't remember that at all.</p>
<p>The future for me probably holds a beat-up original M10 at some point after the M11 is released. Prices should get more reasonable then. I'll probably end up selling the M6 to fund it or something like it. Or maybe I'll sell the MP one day, although the thought makes me shudder. I've had friends say to me, "Never sell a Leica. You always regret selling a Leica." I should probably heed their advice.</p>

	<p>While looking up information for creating <a href="posts/2021/12/31/My-Leica-Camera-Timeline.html">My Leica Camera Timeline</a>, I ended up in a bunch of old Tinderbox documents, dating back to 2008. </p>
<p>The above image shows a project map from my 2009 daybook Tinderbox file. It's so easy to understand what was going on when I can see my notes visually like that. But I also have the same information in a simple outline. </p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/31/Automattic-vs-Ghost---it.html">#</a></span> <p>I prefer creating content in Ghost to WordPress. It's faster, simpler, and generally cleaner. However, I don't love the people behind Ghost. Their goals don't align with mine. Most of the time, who cares? But sometimes I <i>do</i> care. Then I saw <a href="https://initialcharge.net/2021/12/mullenweg-protocol/">Mike Rockwell's post</a> with quotes from Matt Mullenweg and it reminded me that I much prefer Automattic's <i>attitude</i> which is one reason I've reverted <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> to WordPress.</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/30/Yep-still-have-2-blogs.html">#</a></span> <p>I hate the fact that I still have two (active) blogs. Moving <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> to a more blog-friendly template made things confusing. And now this Tinderbox blog is getting so nice that the problem is even worse. They're now both very similar. Too similar.  I think I have to put <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> back as a photography-focused blog with an overwrought template, just to differentiate it from this one. I'm also considering moving this blog to baty.blog and eliminating the Ghost instance running there. And I kind of want to bring back the <a href="http://rudimentarylathe.org">rudimentarylathe.org</a> domain. The elephant in the room, of course, is that you just know I'll change things again in a week or a month or a year. Then what? Broken links, RSS noise, confusion, etc. Anyone reading care to chime in?</p>

	<h3><a href="posts/2021/12/30/Weight-logging-with-Tind.html">Weight logging with Tinderbox</a></h3>

<section>


	<img src="https://daily.baty.net/img/small//img/small/tinderboxicon.png" alt="Weight logging with Tinderbox" class="sideImage">

	<p><i>Note: This was originally posted over at <a href="http://copingmechanism.com">copingmechanism.com</a> but I thought it belonged here instead</i>.</p>
<p>I kept a “daybook” using <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> for years. I drifted away from Tinderbox for a while after becoming infatuated with Linux or iOS or other “cross-platform” systems. Right now, I’m back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>While rebuilding my Daybook, I wanted to make logging my weight easier. It’s not like it was difficult, but I wanted to tweak it.</p>
<p>Tinderbox is an outliner, so my weight entries are collected under a “Weight Log” node. It looked like this (I obviously wasn’t consistent with tracking last year).</p>
<img src="/img/2021/20211230-weight-log.png">
<p>The weight is stored in a numeric User Attribute called, surprisingly, “Weight”. The outline shows a custom “DisplayFormat” so that it reads nicely:</p>
<p><code>$Weight + " pounds on " + format($StartDate,"MM D")</code></p>
<p>To enter a new weight, I’d select an existing item in the outline, hit Return to create a new note, type in the weight, hit Return to save the note, then use the mouse to click the “Weight” attribute and re-enter the weight there. So much clicking!  😀.</p>
<p>What I wanted to do was to type the weight once in the note’s Name and have the Weight attribute populated automatically. Tinderbox notes can have “Rules” which are commands that run periodically and can update a note’s attributes based on just about any criteria. I could have created a rule that set the Weight based on the Name, but that seemed like overkill since this only ever needs to happen once per note.</p>
<p>With some help from Michael Becker, I think I’ve got it. (You should check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQCp8tVRJSg&list=PL6MVDtSfcKxd2XLpenMAd9H4VknDyn6oz">video series on Mastering Tinderbox</a> for all sorts of great Tinderbox content.)</p>
<p>There’s an OnAdd action which sets the Prototype, Date, and Name of the note. (Setting the Name of the new note to “Enter Weight” is a nice touch.)</p>
<p><code>$Prototype="pWeightLogEntry";$Date|=date(today);if($Name=="untitled"){$Name="Enter Weight"};</code></p>
<p>Then, the new note gets a Rule (via the pWeightLogEntry Prototype) which sets the Weight attribute based on the value of Name:</p>

<code><pre>
$Weight|=$Name;
if($Weight>0){
$Name=$Date("l");
$RuleDisabled=true};</pre></code>

<p>The trick here is setting $RuleDisabled=true. What this does is force the Rule to run only once, which is all I need. I wasn’t aware of the $RuleDisabled attribute, so thanks to Michael for that tip.</p>
<p>Now, to add a new Weight Log entry, I hit Return, type my weight, and hit Return again. Couldn’t be any easier! On my Daybooks “Dashboard” I can graph my weight over time, like so…</p>
<img src="/img/2021/20211230-weight.png">
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with Tinderbox, I’m sorry if I made too many assumptions here. Explaining Tinderbox can be an entire job in itself!</p>

<span class="permalinkHash"><a href="posts/2021/12/30/Shot-2-rolls-of-film.html">#</a></span> <p>I'm reviewing my lens situation. The Leica 35mm Summilux-M ASPH is a pricey lens, so I'm rethinking it. I bought the Summilux for the M10-R, which I've now sold. I figured this was fine, since I could still use it on both the film Ms and the SL2-S. On the other hand, I've really been missing that APO Summicron-SL 35 . I've been considering trading the Summilux M for the Summicron SL. That would leave a 35mm gap in my M kit. Since it's film, I can get away with a Zeiss or Voigtlander, right? So I shot a roll with the 50mm Summilux-M and then with the 35 to see how they feel on film. Well, they're both terrific. So now I don't know what to do. For now, I'm just going to shoot more and ignore the entire problem.</p>
